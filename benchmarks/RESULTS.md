# Benchmark results

Measured with BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8 (`--job short --memory`, 3 warmup + 3 measurement
iterations) on this environment:

```
Linux Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, Intel Xeon 2.10GHz, 4 physical cores
.NET SDK 10.0.110, .NET 10.0.10, X64 RyuJIT x86-64-v4, Concurrent Workstation GC
```

ShortRun numbers are indicative; re-run without `--job short` for publication-grade statistics.
**Environment variance caveat**: this is a shared cloud VM whose absolute timings drift up to ~2x
between sessions (the identical `Dictionary rebuild` code measured 11.4-14.8 ms across runs).
Relative ordering and the allocation/GC columns are stable across every run and are the numbers
to trust. Raw reports (CSV + markdown) are in [`results/raw/`](results/raw/), the plotting script
is [`plot_results.py`](plot_results.py).

## Scenario counts (what each benchmark actually does)

The suite models the real workload — a large table in memory, refreshed in batches, read hot:

| Phase | Counts | Benchmark class |
|---|---|---|
| Initial full load | 1,000,000 rows inserted once | `InitialLoadBenchmarks` |
| Periodic refresh (the every-30-seconds batch) | 5,000 upserts, keys uniformly random over the 1M key space | `BatchUpdateBenchmarks` |
| Hot read path | 10,000 random point lookups per invocation | `ReadBenchmarks` |

Row type for the batch scenario: `record Row(long Id, string Name, decimal Balance, DateTime UpdatedAt)`
keyed by `long`. Read/load scenarios use `long → long` to isolate structure cost from row size.

## 1. The 30-second refresh batch (the reason this library exists)

![Batch update time](results/charts/batch-update-time.png)

![Batch update allocation](results/charts/batch-update-alloc.png)

| Method | Mean | Allocated | Gen2/LOH collections |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ImmutableList.SetItem ×B (keyed rows)¹ | 5.96 ms | 1.82 MB | 0 |
| Dictionary rebuild + swap | 11.59 ms | 31.05 MB | yes |
| ImmutableArray.SetItem ×B via builder | 11.90 ms | 30.52 MB | yes — full array copy on LOH |
| **SnapshotTable.ApplyChanges** | **12.45 ms** | 15.33 MB | **0** |
| ImmutableDictionary.SetItems | 14.59 ms | 2.07 MB | 0 |
| FrozenDictionary rebuild | 59.92 ms | 98.45 MB | yes |

¹ Flattered: charged only for row replacement, assuming a free pre-existing key→index map —
maintaining that index is exactly what `SnapshotTable` does and `ImmutableList` doesn't.

**How to read this**: at 1M rows a uniformly random 5k batch touches nearly every 64 KB chunk, so
`SnapshotTable`'s apply time lands in the same band as an O(N) rebuild — the batch is simply not
sparse relative to this table. Its differentiators at this scale are the columns, not the row:
**zero Gen2/LOH activity** (every full-rebuild option hits the LOH each cycle) and dictionary-class
reads (the two structures that allocate less per batch, `ImmutableList`/`ImmutableDictionary`,
read ~9-11× slower and carry 3-5× the steady-state memory). The apply-time advantage grows with
table size as the batch becomes sparse: at 100M rows it is ~5× faster than a rebuild could ever be
(section 4) — and clustered (non-random) batches copy proportionally less at any scale.

## 2. Point lookups (hot path)

![Read time](results/charts/read-time.png)

| Method | Mean (10k lookups) | Per lookup | Allocated |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ImmutableArray[i]² | 8.9 μs | ~1 ns | 0 |
| Dictionary | 137 μs | ~14 ns | 0 |
| FrozenDictionary | 289 μs | ~29 ns | 0 |
| **SnapshotTable.TryGetValue** | **680 μs** | **~68 ns** | **0** |
| **TableSnapshot.TryGetValue** | **802 μs** | **~80 ns** | **0** |
| ImmutableList[i] | 6,267 μs | ~627 ns | 0 |
| ImmutableDictionary | 5,852 μs | ~585 ns | 0 |

² Positional index only — not a keyed lookup; included as the raw-array speed floor.

The honest trade-off: a plain `Dictionary` reads ~5× faster per lookup (~14 ns vs ~68 ns; the
extra cost is the shard-directory hop plus the chunked-row hop). That premium buys lock-free
consistent snapshots and LOH-free refreshes. Against the structures it replaces
(`ImmutableList`/`ImmutableDictionary`) it reads **~9× faster**.

## 3. Initial full load (one-time cost)

![Initial load time](results/charts/initial-load-time.png)

| Method | Mean | Allocated |
|---|---:|---:|
| Dictionary | 15.4 ms | 31.05 MB |
| FrozenDictionary.ToFrozenDictionary | 82.1 ms | 139.35 MB |
| ImmutableList.CreateRange | 109.2 ms | 53.41 MB |
| **SnapshotTable.Reset** | **111.7 ms** | **54.52 MB** |
| ImmutableDictionary.CreateRange | 346.1 ms | 61.04 MB |

Load is `SnapshotTable`'s weakest phase (~7× a raw `Dictionary` fill), but it happens once at
startup and shards are pre-sized from `CapacityHint`, so allocation is now only ~1.8× the raw
data. At 100M rows the measured load rate is 1.4M rows/s (section 4).

## 4. The target workload: 100,000,000 rows, 20,000 changes every 30 seconds

Run end-to-end with the console harness (`--largescale`), workstation GC, 4-core Linux VM, while
two reader threads continuously issued point lookups. Batch mix: 80% updates of random existing
rows, 20% inserts of new rows. Full output: [`results/raw/largescale-100m.txt`](results/raw/largescale-100m.txt).

| Metric | Measured | Budget / context |
|---|---:|---|
| Initial load (one-time) | 72.5 s (1.4M rows/s) | startup only |
| Heap for 100M rows + index | 4.84 GiB | `long → long` rows |
| **LOH size after load** | **0.0 MiB** | the entire structure is small-object |
| Apply 20k-change batch | median 870 ms, max 1,264 ms | 30,000 ms budget (~3%) |
| Allocation per batch | ~90 MiB, Gen0/Gen1 only | vs ~4.8 GiB for any full-rebuild approach |
| GC over 10 cycles | Gen0=55, Gen1=54, Gen2=1 | no LOH-triggered full GCs |
| **LOH growth over 10 cycles** | **0.0 MiB** | the headline guarantee |
| Concurrent reads during refreshes | 1.92 M lookups/s (2 readers) | readers never block |

At this scale no BCL alternative completes the workload cleanly: `ImmutableArray` would copy a
1.6 GB LOH array per batch, a `Dictionary`/`FrozenDictionary` rebuild would allocate ~5 GiB of
LOH-resident structures every 30 seconds, and `ImmutableList`/`ImmutableDictionary` would need
roughly 3-5x the memory and ~11x slower reads.

The structure itself is LOH-free by construction at any row count up to `int.MaxValue`: row chunks
(~4 KB), spine blocks (8 KB), index shards (a few KB each, ~500k of them), directory blocks
(8 KB), and all copy-on-write bookkeeping (bitsets) sit far below the 85,000-byte threshold.
